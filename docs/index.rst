CatMatcher documentation
========================

Welcome to CatMatcher, A Python wrapper for the advanced cross-matching features of the `Starlink Tables Infrastructure Library Tool Set
(STILTS) <https://www.star.bris.ac.uk/~mbt/stilts/sun256/tmatchn.html>`_, offering more flexibility than the Topcat frontend and simplifying
the process of using STILTS via the command line without the need for writing complex shell scripts.

.. note::

   As of *May 2025*, this project is still under active development.
